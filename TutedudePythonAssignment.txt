1. Grade Checker
Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following:
90+ : "A"
80-89 : "B"
70-79 : "C"
60-69 : "D"
Below 60 : "F"
here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.

Ans:
# Take score as input
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

# Check grade using if-else
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print("Your grade is:", grade)


2 Student Grades
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. Allow the user to:
Add a new student and grade.
Update an existing student’s grade.
Print all student grades.
Used dictionary and basic operations. Using if else:

Ans:

student_grades = {}

while True:
    print("\nOptions:")
    print("1. Add a new student and grade")
    print("2. Update an existing student's grade")
    print("3. Print all student grades")
    print("4. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        name = input("Enter student name: ")
        grade = input("Enter grade: ")
        student_grades[name] = grade
        print(f"{name} added with grade {grade}.")
    elif choice == "2":
        name = input("Enter student name to update: ")
        if name in student_grades:
            grade = input("Enter new grade: ")
            student_grades[name] = grade
            print(f"{name}'s grade updated to {grade}.")
        else:
            print(f"{name} not found in records.")
    elif choice == "3":
        if student_grades:  # check if dictionary is not empty
            print("\nAll Student Grades:")
            for name, grade in student_grades.items():
                print(f"{name}: {grade}")
        else:
            print("No student records found.")
    elif choice == "4":
        print("Exiting program.")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


3.Write to a File
Write a program to create a text file and write some content to it.
Using file functions like write and open.

Ans:

file = open("example.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, writing basic Python!\n")
file.write("Writing to file. \n")
file.close()

print("File created and content written successfully.")

4. Read from a File
We used open in read mode and file.read to read and print to display.

Ans:

file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print("File Content:\n", content)
file.close()
