1. Create a new GitHub repository.
Clone the repository to your local machine using SSH (generate an SSH key if needed, add the public key to your GitHub account).
Create a new branch named after your username (e.g., Tutedude).
Add your Flask project files to this branch.
Commit the changes and merge the branch into the main branch.

Answer:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "nithishkumar8341@gmail.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
git clone git@github.com:your-username/flask-project.git
cd flask-project
git checkout -b feet-1
git add .
git commit -m "Added Flask project files"
git push origin feet-1
git checkout main
git merge feet-1
git push origin main


2. Create a new branch named <your_name>_new (e.g., Tutedude_new).
Update the content of the JSON file used for the /api route in this branch.
Merge the <your_name>_new branch into the main branch.
If there are conflicts during the merge, resolve them by accepting the changes from the <your_name>_new branch.
Add the resolved changes to the staging area, commit them, and push the updates to the remote repository.

Answer:
git checkout -b feet-2
git add path/to/api.json
git commit -m "Updated JSON file for /api route"
git push origin feet-2
git checkout main
git merge feet-2
Resolved merge conflicts and updated
git add path/to/api.json
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict by keeping feet-2 changes"
git push origin main


3. Branch Creation:
Create two branches: master_1 and master_2 from the main branch.
Feature Development in master_1:
In the master_1 branch, create a To-Do Page in the frontend.
The page should contain a form with the following fields:
Item Name
Item Description
Backend API in master_2:
In the master_2 branch, create a backend route named /submittodoitem.
This route will:
Accept itemName and itemDescription via a POST request.
Store these details in a MongoDB database.
Merging Changes:
Merge the changes from both master_1 and master_2 into the main branch.

Answer:
git checkout main
git checkout -b master_1
git checkout main
git checkout -b master_2
done the changes (created a To-Do Page)
git add .
git commit -m "Added To-Do Page with form"
git push origin master_1
git checkout master_2
create a backend route named /submittodoitem - done
git add .
git commit -m "Added /submittodoitem backend route with MongoDB integration"
git push origin master_2
git checkout main
git merge master_1
git merge master_2
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts and merged master_1 and master_2"
git push origin main


4. Enhancing the To-Do Form in master_1:
In the master_1 branch, add the following fields to the To-Do form:
Item ID
Item UUID
Item Hash
Committing in Sequence:
Add and commit each field separately in the following order:
First commit: Add Item ID field.
Second commit: Add Item UUID field.
Third commit: Add Item Hash field.
Merging to main:
Merge the master_1 branch into the main branch.
Git Reset and Commit Deletion:
In the main branch, use Git Reset to roll back to the commit where only the Item ID field was added.
Use git reset --soft to ensure changes remain staged.
Re-commit this state to the main branch.
Merge this updated state to the main branch.
Rebasing Changes:
Rebase the updated changes in the main branch to the master_1 branch.
Clarification:
During rebasing, preserve individual commits to maintain the commit history for each change (i.e., do not squash commits).
Use git rebase main master_1 to integrate changes from the main branch back into the master_1 branch.

Answer:
git checkout master_1
Edited To-Do form with Item ID
git add path/to/todo_form.html
git commit -m "Added Item ID field to To-Do form"
Added Item UUID
git add path/to/todo_form.html
git commit -m "Added Item UUID field to To-Do form"
Added Item hash
git add path/to/todo_form.html
git commit -m "Added Item hash field to To-Do form"
git push origin master_1
git checkout main
git merge master_1
git push origin main
git log
git reset --soft b91ad659db513
git commit -m "Re-commit To-Do form with only Item ID field"
git push origin main --force
git checkout master_1
git rebase main
